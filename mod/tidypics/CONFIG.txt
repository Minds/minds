Troubleshooting
=================
If you are experiencing errors, please check your server error log. Tidypics
writes warnings for most upload related problems. You will see something
along these lines: "Tidypics warning: user exceeded post limit on image upload"


GD PHP Image Library
=====================
Elgg requires GD for image resizing of profile avatars. Tidypics uses GD by
default for resizing. There are two versions GD and GD2. It generally does not matter
which one you are using and it isn't always apparent which one you are
running anyway. GD is a memory hog and will cause problems with large images.

imagick PHP Image Library
=============================
A significantly better image library than GD. Not as common as GD. You may need
to ask your system administrator to install this. The server info tab in Tidypics
settings will tell you whether it is installed.

ImageMagick command line tools
===============================
This requires that the PHP function exec() is available which is often disbaled
for security reasons. You can find ImageMagick on your server by running "which convert".

Memory Available to PHP
=========================
The amount of RAM available to a single PHP process. This can have an effect on
how large an image you can resize (especially if you are running Tidypics with GD).
The best place to change it is .htaccess.

Memory Used to Load This Page
==============================
This gives you a baseline of how much memory is being used to load the Elgg
framework and plugins. Subtract this number from the total amount of memory available
for image processing. Remember that GD requires a lot of memory - more than just the
size of the image.

Max File Upload Size
=======================
The largest file that can be uploaded. You can adjust this in .htaccess.

Max Post Size
===============
The largest amount of data that can be submitted. For Tidypics, this affects
how many large images can be uploaded in a single upload with the basic uploader.
If this is exceeded, nothing is uploaded and the user gets an error message.
It can be adjusted in .htaccess.

Max Input Time
===============
This is the amount of time PHP will wait for an upload to finish. Your users may
experience failures if they are uploading large images on a poor connection or if
your server does not have a lot of bandwidth.

Max Execution Time
===================
The longest time a PHP script can run on your server. If a user uploads many
large images, the resize code may take a long time to complete and will be
stopped by PHP. If you are seeing problems with this, you probably have a slow server.

GD imagejpeg
===============
This tells you whether you can resize JPEG images with GD

GD imagegif
===============
This tells you whether you can resize GIF images with GD

GD imagepng
===============
This tells you whether you can resize PNG images with GD
