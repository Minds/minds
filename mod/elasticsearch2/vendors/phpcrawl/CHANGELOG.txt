Version 0.80 beta
2012/04/23

Version 0.80 was (almost) completely rewritten and ported to "proper" object oriented PHP5-code.
It brings new features like the ability to use multiple processes to spider a website and a new,
internal, hdd-based caching-mechanism making it possible to spider even very huge websites. Even 
though some methods and options were renamded and redone, phpcrawl 0.8 should be fully compatible
to older versions. 

The changes in detail:

* Code was completely refactored, ported to PHP5-OO-code and a lot of code was rewritten.

* Added the ability to use use multiple processes to spider a website. Method "goMultiProcessed()"
added.

* New overridable method "initChildProcess()" added for initiating child-processes when using the
crawler in multi-process-mode.

* Implementet an alternative, internal SQlite caching-mechanism for URLs making it possible to spider
very large websites. Method "setUrlCacheType()" added.
  
* New method setWorkingDirectory() added for defining the location of the crawlers temporary
working-directory manually. Therefor method "setTmpFile()" is marked as deprecated (has no function
anymore).

* New method "addContentTypeReceiveRule()" replaces the old method "addReceiveContentType()".
The function "addReceiveContentType()" still is present, but was marked as deprecated.
  
* New method "addURLFollowRule()" replaces the old method "addFollowMatch()".
The function "addFollowMatch()" still is present, but was marked as deprecated.
  
* New method "addURLFilterRule()" replaces the old method "addNonFollowMatch()".
The function "addNonFollowMatch()" still is present, but was marked as deprecated.
  
* The crawler now is able to parse and obey "nofollow"-tags defined as meta-tags or rel-options
(like "<a href="page.html" rel="nofollow">") Method "obeyNoFollowTags()" added.
  
* Overridabel user-method "handleDocumentInfo()" replaces the old method "handlePageData()".
Method "handlePageData()" still exists, but was marked as deprecated.
The new method now provides information about a document as a PHPCrawlerDocumentInfo-object instead of an array.
  
* New method "enableAggressiveLinkSearch()" replaces the old method "setAggressiveLinkExtraction()".
The function "setAggressiveLinkExtraction()" still is present, but was marked as deprecated.
  
* New method "setLinkExtractionTags()" replaces the old method "addLinkExtractionTags()" (since it
was named wrong,it didn't add tags, it overwrites tha tag-list).
The function "addLinkExtractionTags()" still is present, but was marked as deprecated.
  
* New method "addStreamToFileContentType()" replaces the old method "addReceiveToTmpFileMatch()".
The function "addReceiveToTmpFileMatch()" still is present, but was marked as deprecated.
  
* New method "enableCookieHandling()" replaces the old method "setCookieHandling()".
The function "setCookieHandling()" still is present, but was marked as deprecated.
  
* It's possible now to use a proxy-server for spidering websites. Method "setProxy()" added.

* Method "addReceiveToMemoryMatch()" has no function anymore and is marked as deprecated (since it
was redundant). Users should use addStreamToFileContentType() now instead.
  
* Method "disableExtendedLinkInfo()" has no function anymore and is marked as deprecated.
To reduce the memory-usage of the crawler users now should use the internal SQLite-urlcache
(by calling "setUrlCacheType(PHPCrawlerUrlCacheTypes::URLCACHE_SQLITE)").

* New method "getProcessReport()" replaces the old method "getReport()".
The function "getReport()" still is present, but was marked as deprecated.
  
* Method "setFollowRedirectsTillContent()" has no function anymore and was marked as deprecated
(since it completely interfered with other settings and rules that can be applied to the crawler).

* New overridable method "handleHeaderInfo()" added. This method will be called after the header
of a document was received and BEFORE the content will be received. Gives the user the opportunity
to abort the request (based on the http-header the server responded).

* Added some more information about found documents to the array (respectively PHPCrawlerDocumentInfo-object)
that is passed to the overridable user-function handleDocumentInfo(): cookies (all cookies the server
with the document), responseHeader (header the webserver responded a PHPCrawlerResponseHeader-object),
error_occured (flag indication whether an error occured during the request), data_transfer_rate (average
data-transferrate for receiving the document), data_transfer_time (time it took to receive the document)
and meta_attributes (all meta-tag atteributes found in the source of the document).

* Added the ability to send post-data with requests for defined URLs, method "addPostData()" added.

* Fixed bug 3368719: When creating two (or more) instances of the crawler and obeyRobotsTxt() was
set to true in both of them, the second call of the go()-method caused a fatal error.

* Fixed bug 3368722: Flag "file_limit_reached" in the array that getReport() returns wasn't set to
true when a page-limimt (setPageLimit()) was hit.

* Fixed bug 3389965: phpcrawl now shouldn't throw any notices and warnings anymore when error_reporting
is set to E_STRICT or E_ALL.

* Fixed bug 3413627: Links like "<a href="?page=3">" get recognized and rebuild correctly now.

* Fixed bug 3465964: Robots.txt-documents get parsed correctly now, even if the "User-agent"-directive
in robots.txt-files is written like "user-agent" or "User-Agent".

* Fixed bug 3485155: Links like "test.htm?redirect=http://www.foo.ie&a=b" get recognized and rebuild
correctly now.

* Fixed bug 3504517: Requests for links containing special characters (like "הצ") sometimes didn't work
as expected due to wrong character-encoding (server responded 404 NOT FOUND).

* Fixed bug 3510270: The array "links_found" of the array $page_data passed to the function
handlePageData() never contained a linktext.


Version 0.71
2011/06/30
    
* Bugfix: Empty links found in documents (like <a href="">) are rebuild correctly now 
so that they lead to the same document they were found in.

* Bugfix: It's possible now to initiate more than one instance of the phpcrawler-class 
without getting an "Fatal error: Call to undefined method stdClass::receivePage()" error.

* A new method "setLinkExtractionTags()" replaces the "addLinkExtractionTags()" method.
The old method addLinkExtractionTags() is named wrong since it doesn't ADD new tags, it 
OVERWRITES the tag-list.
addLinkExtractionTags() still exists for compatibility-reasons, but was marked as deprecated.

* Bugfix: Links containing spaces like <a href="any file.hmtl"> are recognized and 
processed correctly now.

* Bugfix: Links containing quotes like <a href="any'file.html"> are recognized and 
processed correctly now.

* The search-patterns used for agressive link-extractions (if setAggressiveLinkExtraction() 
set to TRUE) were redone. They should give some better results now.

* Bugfix: Phpcrawl doesn't crash anymore with a segmentation fault when parsing links that 
are laid over very long text or html 
(like <a href="foo,htm"> ... very very long text goes here ...</a>)

* Method addLinkSearchContentType() added.
It's possible now to manually define what kind of documents should get parsed in order to 
find links in (according to their content/mime-type).
Before (and still by default) only documents of type "text/html" get checked for links.

* Bugfix: Links containing linebreaks are recognized and processed correctly now. 

* Default value for socket-stream-timeout increased to 5 seconds.
Although this can be set manually by using the setStreamTimeout()-method, the default value of 2 seconds
was a little to low.

* Fixed some minor-bugs ih the test-interface and updated the containing example-setup (since
the old one didn't work anymore because of site-changes over at php.net)
    

Version 0.70
2007/01/05 

* New function setLinkPriority() added. Its possible now to set different
priorities (priority-levels) for different links.

* Found links are cached now in a different way so that the general
performance was improved, especially when cralwing a lot of pages (big sites)
in one process.

* Added support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), so links like "https://.."
will be followed corretly now.
Please note that the PHP OpenSSL-extension is required for it to work.

* The link-extraction and other parts were redone and should give better results
now.

* Methods setAggressiveLinkExtraction() and addLinkExtractionTag() added for
setting up the link extraction manually.

* Added support for robots.txt-files, method obeyRobotsTxt() added.

* More information about found pages and files will be passed now to the method
handlePageData(), especially information about all found links in the current
page is available now. Method disableExtendedLinkInfo() added.

* The crawler now is able to handle links like "http://www.foo.com:123" correctly
and will send requests to the correct port. Method setPort() added.

* The content of pages and files now can be received/streamed diretly to a temporary
file instead of to memory, so now it shouldn't be a problem anymore to let the
crawler receive big files.
Methods setTmpFile(), addReceiveToTmpFileMatch() and addReceiveToMemoryMatch() added.

* Added support for basic authentication. Now the crawler is able to crawl protected
content. Method addBasicAuthentication() added.

* Now its possible to abort the crawling-process by letting the overridable function
handlePageData() return any negative value.

* Method setUserAgentString() added for setting the user-agent-string in
request-headers the crawler sends.

* A html-testinterface for testing the different setups of the crawler is included in
the package now.

* The crawler doesn't do DNS-lookups anymore for every single page-request, only if the
host is changing a lookup will be done once. This improves performance a little bit.

* The crawler doesn't look for links anymore in every file it finds, only
"text/html"-content will be checked for links.

* Fixed problem with rebuilding links like "*foo".

* Fixed problem with splitting/rebuilding URLs like
"http://foo.bar.com/?http://foo/bar.html".

* Fixed problem that the crawler handled i.e. "foo.com" and "www.foo.com" as different
hosts.


Version 0.65_pl2
2005/08/22

* Phpcrawl now doesn't throw any notices anymore when error-reporting
  is set to E_ALL. Thanks to elitec0der!

* Also there shouldn't be any notices anymore when "allow_call_time_pass_reference"
  is set to OFF. Thanks philipx!
  
* Fixed a bug that appeared when running the crawler in followmode 3.
  (The crawler never went "path up" anymore)
  
* Now the crawler sends the referer-header with requests correctly again.


Version 0.65_pl1 (patchlevel 1)
2004/08/06

Just a few bugs were fixed in this version:
(Yes, it took a time, sorry)

* The crawler doesn't send empty "Cookie:" header anymore if there's no cookie to send.
  (A few webserver rerturned a "bad request" header to this) Thanks Mark!

* The crawler doesn't send one and the same cookie-header several times with a request
  anymore if it was set more than one time by the server. (Didn't really matter though)

* Crawler will find links in metatags used with single quotation marks (') like
  <META HTTP-EQUIV='refresh' CONTENT='foo; URL=http://bar/'> now. Thanks Arsa!

* HTTP 1.0 requests will be send now because of problems with HTTP 1.1 headers and
  chunked content. Thanks Arsa again!
