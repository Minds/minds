  deprecated functions from access.php - private_settings.php to
  deprecated.php.  Still have to do relationships.php - xml.php.  Deleted
  documentation for these functions since 1) it was using up precious bytes,
  and 2) documentation should not be needed since people should not be trying
  to use these if they are using 1.8, and 3) I assume the documentation will
  exist as archived 1.7 docs.

  spread across execute_query() and get_data*(). Namespacing cache for callback
  and single row request. I'm open to better names for that function. Not
  closing #1242 because the elgg_get_entities*() functions can still return
  false.

  authorization for REST by default - developers can add their own custom PAM
  using the plugin hook if they require this

  	* engine/lib/filestore.php, engine/tests/elgg_unit_test.php,

  the owner's username to determine a file path matrix based on (up to) the
  first five letters. To eliminate language and filesystem inconsistencies, the
  matrix is now created from the entity's creation date and guid. This has the
  added benefit of (potentially) allowing users to update their usernames.

  	* engine/tests/objects/entities.php, engine/tests/objects/objects.php,
  engine/tests/test_skeleton.php: Swallowing all Elgg notices within unit
  tests.  By default, SimpleTest converts PHP errors into exceptions. This is
  restricted by adding a call to swallowErrors() within the tearDown() methods.
  This has also been noted within the unit test skeleton.  

  	* engine/lib/sites.php, engine/tests/objects/sites.php: Creating a generic
  ElggSite unit test.

  engine/tests/suite.php: Adding unit tests for the ElggObject class. 
  Restricting testing suite to only be run as a logged-in user. This will not
  allow the tests to be run from the command line, but this is already the case
  due to debug static.

  	* actions/register.php, engine/lib/entities.php: Fixes #1196:

  get_annotations() and __get_annotations_calculate_x() and its helpers.

  	* engine/lib/users.php: Closes #584: Removed exception, get_user will now
  return false if GUID exists but is not a user. This probably makes more sense
  as Exceptions should probably be reserved for major Ooopses.  The error in
  this bug was caused by this exception being thrown and not caught in the
  access group handler. This may have been the cause of a number of group
  related / permission related errors.

  	* engine/lib/filestore.php, engine/lib/users.php, languages/en.php: Closes
  #254: If mb_string is installed then internationalised usernames are
  supported in file system.  Because of this I have raised mbstring from
  recommended to a (non-fatal) core requirement.  Because of the lack of a
  unicode ctype_alnum function the validation occurs at username input. Because
  of this I have improved the user registration code:  This code now validates
  for special chars etc in the username. I have also introduced the following
  new plugin hooks (which are run after primary validation) which provide
  plugins with the ability to add other requirements (extra security etc). 
  'registeruser:validate:password' 'registeruser:validate:username'
  'registeruser:validate:email'  Marcus Povey 25/8/08

  overruled by page handling settings, if set, which use the first element of
  the URL to determine context. Fixes #32

  count based on this conversation:  [10:05:38] … basically, if you add an
  item, you need to create a tag entry in the metastrings table (as discussed

  [10:06:07] … if you want to delete the tag when nothing references it
  [10:06:11] … it needs a counter [10:06:29] … which means for every add
  and delete query you need to check for and sometimes update this counter
  [10:06:36] … making three queries for every one [10:06:47] … but if you
  don't do that the meta strings table grows over time [10:06:54] … making it
  space inefficient [10:07:03] … so, which do you do? [10:10:31] … ?
  [10:10:43] … i'd be tempted to not delete [10:10:58] … because the
  multiple queries will be a pain for everyone all the time [10:11:05] … and
  storage costs are cheap [10:11:32] Ben Werdmuller: I would be very tempted to
  do the same [10:11:35] … so let's do that :) [10:11:36] Marcus Povey: maybe
  we could write an admin script to clean up or something [10:11:45] Ben
  Werdmuller: exactly, we could clean up on a cron if people really want
  [10:11:59] … but for now, let's just go with the growing tag cloud
